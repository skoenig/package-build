If you find package-build useful for your own infrastructure, but want to make it even more awsome, you are welcome to contribute to it!
You can either contribute to the recipes - please check whether there is really no fpm-cookery recipe already existing in some other repository to build a certain package - or make changes to the project itself. In the latter case please follow this process:

1. Check if there is already an [issue](https://github.com/zalando/package-build/issues) for your concern.
1. If not, create open a new issue to describe your proposed change.
1. Fork the repo and create a new branch on which you base your work.
1. Make small commits with meaningful commit messages.
1. Send a PR against [zalando/package-build](https://github.com/zalando/package-build) with its comment referencing the corresponding issue ID.
